          Hi, I&apos;m Corri. I am a working husband and father, who is looking to change career paths and have attended a UNH Coding bootcamp in web-development in order to accomplish this.
          I have always had a great interest in all things tech due to my father working on computers for most of my life.
          It&apos;s also interesting to see how computers function internally whether rendering a webpage or seeing how JavaScript logic thinks so I can understand in part how a videogame or webpage works under the hood.
          I am coming from the automotive field but due to some medical reasons I need to have a less physical job for my own physical well-being.
          Its neat to see what kind of logic may be used in some of the video games that I play in my spare time. 
          This coding bootcamp has given me a great opportunity to learn something I find very interesting while also being a great potential career path.
          I&apos;m excited about learning this field because of the large ceiling to better advance my own personal skills in this.
          I have always loved learning how things work and applying as much as I can to whatever I&apos;m doing.
          If any of what I have said interests you please take a few minutes to look at my GitHub or LinkedIn that have been linked below or
          if you want to see a few highlighted projects please checkout my portfolio page that has links to the specific repos, thank you!
